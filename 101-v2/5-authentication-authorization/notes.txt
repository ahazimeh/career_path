authentication factors:
knowledge
  something only the user knows (password, code...)
  risk (storage, transmission)
ownership
  something only the user processes (authenticator)
  risk (if the authenticator got stolen, cloaning, unauthorized usage (kept phone opened))
inherence
  something the user is (fingerprint)
  also devices are different
    physical unclonable function (puff)
    risk (cannot be replaced if exposed)
    used only for local authentication

server verify password:
  case 1: store passowrd in clear text
  case 2: server stores the digest of the passwords (hash)

reusable passowrds
  password sniffing (http)
  password database attacks
  password guessing
  password enumeration
  same password

password storage:
  client side
    memorize in head, use encrypted file, password manager...
  server side
    never in Cleartext
    store the digest
    dictionary attack
    rainbow table
    salt

challenge response authentication
  challenge must not be repeatable to avoid replay
  replies with the solution of the challenge
  server computes his own solution and compare
  the function must be non-invertable

Symetric CRA
  alice send ID
  server send back Nonce { 345464445346345 }
  client sends back Hmac(Nonce, Kc)

Symetric CRA Attack
  Mutual Symetric CRA (both ways)

Asymmetrnic CRA

MFA/2FA
multifactor authentication
  at least one of those factors should be non-reusable
OTP
  One-time passowrd
  Password valid for one time only
  imune to sniffing
  must be protected from brute-force

the S-key System
  p1=hash(sid) // sid is secret
  p2=hash(p1)
  p3=hash(p2) ...

Time Based OTP
  hash(secret, time)
  clock syncronization between server and user
  requires time slot or window time slot. // up to 30 seconds

  time attacks:
    -on client
      pretend to be an otp server and send fake time
      check my phone and steal future otps by modifying the phone time to tomorrow
    -on server
      pretend to be an otp server and send fake time (on the server)
