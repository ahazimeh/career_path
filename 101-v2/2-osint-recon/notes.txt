what should we gather:
  domains, subdomains, asns, network services

reverse proxy (cloud flare)

cidr (list ip address 203.0.0.114/24) // scan all cidr for the company -> from cidr you can reach a host that can reach to open ports

find more main domains:
  -crunchbase.com //research a company to look for more websites they own
  -trademark // google "Copyright 2024 Sony Corporation" and check all domains for the company
  -ask ai: provide me with the domains and organizations owned by X
  -favicon
    open the favicon of a website and get the url for the favicon
    go to website: favicon-hash.kmsec.uk and get the hash
    I can search in shodan.io
  -whois facebook.com (you can pay for the company hosting your website to protect your info (whoisguard))
    -automatted tools: doomlink (Needs WHOXY API Key), amass
      https://viewdns.info/reversewhois // you can add an email and check what domains he published
  -another tool will get the email and check the domains from these emails
    https://reversewhois.io/
  -tldhunt:
    ./tldhunt.sh -k ibm -E tlds.txt

gather cidr:
  asn: group of cidr
    manual: bgp.he.net (search for ibm)
    automatter tools: metabigor, asnlookup, amass, asnmap
    metabigor
      discover ip of a company/organization
        echo facebook | ./metabigor net --org -o /tmp/result.txt
      discover ip of an asn
        echo AS54115 | ./metabigor net --org -o /tmp/result.txt
          after this
          echo 173.0.84.0/24 | /home/mansour/go/bin/dnsx -selent -resp-only -ptr (it will give you all the domains)

Collect subdomains
  -virustotal.com (check if file, url, domain is malicious)
    https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/avast.com/relations // here in the relations you can view subdomains
  -github-subdomains -d apple.com -t your_token
    this search for apple.com inside github
  -gitlab: /home/..../gitlab-subdomains -d apple.com -t your_token
  -waybackurls
    waybackurls apple.com > apple.txt
    sed -E 's#^(https?://)?([^/]+).*#\2#' apple.txt | uinq // only give me subdomains and not all urls
    subfinder -d facebook.com (use api token will provide you with better results)
  -./sudomy -d bugcrowd.com // collects subdomains in automatted way
    it gives subdomains, port scan, cloudflare, min al live wil unalive hosts, env variables, content, technologies
