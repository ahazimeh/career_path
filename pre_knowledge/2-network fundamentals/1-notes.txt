interface: change the data from transmitter to electric signals, and in receiver from electric signals to data (0s and 1s)
  fiber: bits to light signals
network protocol: set of rules, same network protocol for communications

network topology (layout of a network)

1-bus topology (a cable and devices connected to it)
  central cable that makes the whole network busy (low performance)
  all devices rely on the central cable and any issue in it will break the whole network
  data is sent for all devices
2-ring topology (circle)
  easy
  no data collision
  issues:
  should pass between all devices that are between the sender and receiver
  all devices rely on the central cable and any issue in it will break the whole network
  difficult to add new devices
3- mesh topology (each device is connected with other devices)
  no fault tolerence
  point to point link
  security better
  issues:
  more expensive
  more complex network
4- star topology (central device adn each device connected to it)
  inexpensive
  scalable
  disadvantage
  single point of failure (solved by redundency by adding aditional switches)

casting: send data through network
  1- unicast: (1 to 1)
  2- multicast: (1 to many) message for group
  3- broadcast (1 to all)
    limited (send to all devices in same network) send data for all devices in the network (last ip address)
    direct broadcast (send to another group for all devices)

transmission modes:
  1- simplex mode (radio)
  2- half duplex mode (2 ways but not at same time)
  3- full duplex mode (2 ways but and at same time) (call)


lesson 5:
types of networks (geo)
  1- PAN(10 to 15m) (mobile and tablet with labtop)
  2- LAN
  3- WLAN
  4- CAN (2 or more lans)
  5- MAN
  6- SAN
  7- WAN

lesson 6:
types of networks (host role)
  p2p (peer to peer)
  client/server

layers:
application layer (protocols)
presentation layer (take data in human language to machine language) then compress and encryption
session layer transmission mode and session management
transport layer: segmentation (each segment have port and sequence number)
  flow control, amount of data that can be sent (if receiver can't receive enough data then it will slow things down)
network layer: (logical addressing and routing)
data link layer: physical addressing  (mac address for sender and receiver)
  it let upper layers access the media (transmission media)
  depending on the media between 2 pc the data link layer will add data in head and trailer for the ip packet
  - it can add framing, access upper levels in ois model
  error detection and correction

error detection
  -parity checking
  -checksum
  -crc

data link layer uses protocol called csma (watch traffic and send his message when there is no traffic in the cable)

physical layer (change bits to signals so transmiision media can understand it)

dns servers: dns resolver, root name server (4 servers all websites), tld server (ex: all sites ending with .com), authortative name server (verify if user is authorized to access ip)
  pc communicate with dns resolver, go to roon name server, then sends back the ip for .com
  then dns resolver will communicate with tld server which will send the authortative name server, then dns resolver will communicate with authortative name server to get the ip address

get automatic ip address from dhcp server

no ip address:
  1- send broadcast to all devices in the network (this packet called dhcp discover) -soure ip address 0.0.0.0, destination ip address 255.255.255.255
  2- dhcp server sends back dhcp offer (proposed ip address, subnet, leasa time)
  3- dhcp request (accept the ip address)
  4- dhcp acknowledgament: configuration for all ip settings
network admin will configure dhcp to distribute the addresses with certain range
assign ip address as a lease

request for many ip addresses
address reservation (reserve a mac for certain ip address such as printer)

arp (address resolution protocol)
  connect mac address with ip address for target device
  arp cash (mac addresses in the network that I communicated with)


network devices (hub, switch, router)
  1- hub: connect devices together in 1 network
    contains ports to connect devices with ethernet
    send data to all connected devices
    bad bandwidth and sends data to all
    1 layer (physical)
    half duplex
  2- switch:
    work with mac address so he only sends for who needs the message
    switch table
    fast detection for device
    layer to device
    full duplex
    multiple collision domain
    save bandwidth
    increase security
router:
  layer 3 device
  routing table (interface mac address)
