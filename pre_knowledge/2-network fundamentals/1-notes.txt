interface: change the data from transmitter to electric signals, and in receiver from electric signals to data (0s and 1s)
  fiber: bits to light signals
network protocol: set of rules, same network protocol for communications

network topology (layout of a network)

1-bus topology (a cable and devices connected to it)
  central cable that makes the whole network busy (low performance)
  all devices rely on the central cable and any issue in it will break the whole network
  data is sent for all devices
2-ring topology (circle)
  easy
  no data collision
  issues:
  should pass between all devices that are between the sender and receiver
  all devices rely on the central cable and any issue in it will break the whole network
  difficult to add new devices
3- mesh topology (each device is connected with other devices)
  no fault tolerence
  point to point link
  security better
  issues:
  more expensive
  more complex network
4- star topology (central device adn each device connected to it)
  inexpensive
  scalable
  disadvantage
  single point of failure (solved by redundency by adding aditional switches)

casting: send data through network
  1- unicast: (1 to 1)
  2- multicast: (1 to many) message for group
  3- broadcast (1 to all)
    limited (send to all devices in same network) send data for all devices in the network (last ip address)
    direct broadcast (send to another group for all devices)

transmission modes:
  1- simplex mode (radio)
  2- half duplex mode (2 ways but not at same time)
  3- full duplex mode (2 ways but and at same time) (call)


lesson 5:
types of networks (geo)
  1- PAN(10 to 15m) (mobile and tablet with labtop)
  2- LAN
  3- WLAN
  4- CAN (2 or more lans)
  5- MAN
  6- SAN
  7- WAN

lesson 6:
types of networks (host role)
  p2p (peer to peer)
  client/server

layers:
application layer (protocols)
presentation layer (take data in human language to machine language) then compress and encryption
session layer transmission mode and session management
transport layer: segmentation (each segment have port and sequence number)
  flow control, amount of data that can be sent (if receiver can't receive enough data then it will slow things down)
network layer: (logical addressing and routing)
data link layer: physical addressing  (mac address for sender and receiver)
  it let upper layers access the media (transmission media)
  depending on the media between 2 pc the data link layer will add data in head and trailer for the ip packet
  - it can add framing, access upper levels in ois model
  error detection and correction

error detection
  -parity checking
  -checksum
  -crc

data link layer uses protocol called csma (watch traffic and send his message when there is no traffic in the cable)

physical layer (change bits to signals so transmiision media can understand it)
