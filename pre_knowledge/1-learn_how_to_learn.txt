-defused mode (not fucused when thinking such as once sleeping and thinking with weird things) // you should write these ideas because you will forget them

when learning new thing 2 5aleyya gets neural linked, at the beginning this link is easy to gets unlinked

you can learn 4 info for short memory
to move info to long memory then you need to repeat it for multiple times at long separate durations (over weeks)
training in gym for 10 hours in 1 day have less results as training 10 hours in a month

sleep well:
when sleeping you brain will repair the links that was made

73% of brain is water so drink well

to memorize:
1-learn the info you are learning in a funny way or in a way of exaguration
2-images are easier to memorize that the knowledge itself
you can memorize 10 or 20 info in the short memory with this

one is a bun
two is a shoe
three is a tree
four is a door
five is a hive
six is sticks
seven is heaven
eight is a gate
nine is wine
ten is a hen

if someone mentioned car first thing, so you can imagine a car with a bun sandwich and it drinking fuel
so you related the car with something with exaguration in a funny way which will help you memorize
this is called nmemonics (art of hacking your memory to learn faster)

3-melody
4-take first letter of each info and make a word
5-before learning try to bring info back and write in your hand, before getting started say out lound what you remember and write it down
6-flash card, write the info in the face of the card and what is related to it in the other side
7-memory palace (you imaging a place that you memorize well such as your home) and try imagining the new info you want to learn inside the home
(imaging like putting soap in the intrance of your home so you need to wash your hands when you get home, tomato and cucumber in the chair fighting...)

procrastination:
if you don't like that you have to do, then it will be painful so your brain will try to make you do other stuff to protect you
solution:
1-talk to yourself loadly (Stop procrastination and do your job or else it will give you more pressure if you didn't finish it that you can't handle)
2-focus on the time and not what you need to do (I will learn 25 minutes then will take a break)
3-start with the easiest (so you can get started) (you can learn 25min and then break for 5 to 10 minutes)
4-put aside all distrations
5-you will reward yourself after completing your 25minutes

on average you think a day with 70000 ideas so don't believe when someone says he is thinking with nothing
chunking: strategy to learn a lot of things in a short period of time
(as memorizing each few numbers together (specially if they are related)) // you can also give a story for each chunk if possible

10 advice:
  1-physical activities helps memory and removing stress and pressure specially before exams
  2-don't compare yourself with others doing better
  3-group learning
  4-start with easy when learning and hard on exam (to let your brain start working fast, 1 to 2 minutes and then go for the easy question)
  5-avoid over usage of the highlighter
  6-when learning try to test yourself for your understanding by trying to solve it without looking at the solution
  7-review what you memorized in different places because when you go to exam you will be in different environment than your room
  8-calm down (think like: this is not fear but excitement)
  9-mcq: before answering try to hide the choices and answer them so this will help you in case the answers look alike and are confusing
  10-take break even for few seconds before double checking your answer because your brain will tell you that what you did is correct
  before day of exam just review the main points and don't burn yourself with studying



english:
