-Over Pass The Ticket
-Token impersonation (copying token and using it in my session) // process running as John because there is a token for John inside this process
-Process impersonation

when passing the hash I add new process and put the hash, then I do injection on this process and use the token

pass the hash:
  usemodule powershell_..._pth
  set user robb.stark
  set domain north.sevenkingdoms.local
  set ntln hash
  set CredtID 5 // I can use this rather than me filling them manually as above
  execute

pass the ticket:
  same principle
  I dump
