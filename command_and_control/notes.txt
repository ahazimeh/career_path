communications channel between compromised hosts and attacker
Enables remote control, data exfiltration, and lateral movemnet
  key term: simulating advanced persistent threats (APTs)

How C2 Works
  1- initial access (phishing, explit, etc.)
  2- payload delivery to target host
  3- agent/beacon connects to c2 server
  4- command execution and data collection

How a C2 Work?
Open-Source Options:
  -Empire - PowerShell & Python post-exploitation
  -Cobalt Strike (Community Edition) - Commercial/Red Team
  -Silver C2 - Modern cross-platform C2
  -

What is Empire?
  Open-source post-exploitation & C2 framework
  Developed for PowerShell and Python agents
  supports Windows, Linux, and macOS
Why Red Teams Use It:
  fileless payloads (PowerShell-based)
  strong obfuscation for evasion
  integration with Mimikatz & other modules

Empire Architecture
  components:
    1- listener - waits for agents to connect
    2- agents - payload that executes commands on the target
    3- stagers - initial loader to deploy agents
    4- modules - Scrips for credential dumping, lateral movemnet, etc.
